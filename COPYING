GLQUERY IS PUBLIC DOMAIN SOFTWARE
---------------------------------

glQuery is open source software released into the public domain using the CC0
dedication. For the formal legal code please read licenses/LEGALCODE-cc0-1.0.

Note that CC0 is approved by the Free Software Foundation and is fully
compatible with the GPL and other permissive open source software licenses such
as the MIT license. In countries where a public domain dedication cannot
be recognized legally, the CC0 dedication provides an extremely permissive
open source license.

Here's a quick human readable summary of the CC0 dedication from the Creative 
Commons website, http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

No Copyright:

    The person who associated a work with this deed has dedicated the work to
    the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide
    under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the
    extent allowed by law.

    You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial
    purposes, all without asking permission.

Other Information:

  * In no way are the patent or trademark rights of any person affected by
    CC0, nor are the rights that other persons may have in the work or in how
    the work is used, such as publicity or privacy rights.
  * Unless expressly stated otherwise, the person who associated a work with
    this deed makes no warranties about the work, and disclaims liability for
    all uses of the work, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
  * When using or citing the work, you should not imply endorsement by the
    author or the affirmer.

MAKING MODIFICATIONS
--------------------

If you would like to retain copyright on your modifications to glQuery then
we advise you to please first delete the licenses/LEGALCODE-cc0-1.0 and COPYING
files in order to avoid any confusion. When distributing your work you should
also consider modifying the header (from src/header.js) that is added to the 
distribution files. This will let people know that you do not to wish to
dedicate your own changes to the public domain.

The glQuery team will not accept any pull requests or patches that are not
fully released into the public domain.

(This obviously does not extend to external plugins. Feel free to create
plugins using any open source license of your choosing! If it's well written
and generally useful we'll even offer to add it to https://github.com/glQuery)
